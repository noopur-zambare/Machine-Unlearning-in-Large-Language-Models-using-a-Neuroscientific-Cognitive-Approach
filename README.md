# Machine-Unlearning-in-Large-Language-Models-using-a-Neuroscientific-Cognitive-Approach

Our brains are remarkable devices that can learn new things, but what happens when we have to let go of knowledge that is out of date or inaccurate? In the human brain, unlearning is a complicated process with many steps that involve a fascinating balance of neurons and memories.

### Brain & Unlearning
- Recognizing the Glitch: The brain's competing messages are the first step in this. Consider the firing of two neurons, each of which represents a distinct memory. They clash, sending up a warning flag, an inside "huh?" Emotions also have an impact. The brain marks something for further examination if it feels odd. Unlearning can be triggered even by external feedback, such as a friend's perplexed expression.

### Working of Neuroscientific-Cognitive Approach for Machine Unlearning
- Developed and improved a state-of-the-art unlearning algorithm for Large Language Models by adding extensive representations of the memory system, modulations of the attention mechanism, and other cognitive processes motivated by neuroscience.
- Created an adaptive threshold mechanism for the reconsolidation window to optimise unlearning timing and requirement depending on error severity, concept usage frequency, and emotional connotations.
